<h1>9.7 Of Future Ideas</h1>
</header>
<p><span class="add">Controverted Point</span>: That a consciousness, having an idea that is future, is without object.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.1-2' href='#pts-cs1.1.1-2'>PTS cs 1.1.1–2</a><span class="add">These §§ are verbatim as in</span> <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs9.6'>PTS CS 9.6</a>, “future” <span class="add">substituted for</span> “past”.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc238' href='#pc238'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.3' href='#pts-cs1.1.3'>PTS cs 1.1.3</a>continues: You admit of course concerning what is present, that there can be adverting of mind, ideation, and so on (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs9.6.2'>PTS CS 9.6.2</a>), so that consciousness of a present idea has its mental object. And you admit that there can be adverting of mind and the rest about the past and also about the future. Yet in both these cases mind, you say, is without mental object. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.4' href='#pts-cs1.1.4'>PTS cs 1.1.4</a> Why not also say then that, while there can be adverting of mind, etc., about the present, mind occupied about a present object is mind without object?</p>
<p><span class="add">Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.5' href='#pts-cs1.1.5'>PTS cs 1.1.5</a>But you admit that a “past object” does not exist <span class="add">at the present moment</span>? Surely then a mind occupied with past object is occupied with no (that is, with a non-existent) object … .</p>

<li>Abbreviations, i.e., those of cited works and the participants in the controversies, were expanded.</li>
<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
<li>The corrigenda were merged into the text. Some could not be resolved, though.</li>
