<h1>9.11 Of Action conforming to Thought</h1>
</header>
<p><span class="add">Controverted Point</span>: That action does not accord with thought.</p>
<p><span class="add">Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.1-3' href='#pts-cs1.1.1-3'>PTS cs 1.1.1–3</a>(<span class="add">The argument is exactly similar to that in</span> <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs9.10.1'>PTS CS 9.10.1</a>.)</p>
<p>Again,<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.4' href='#pts-cs1.1.4'>PTS cs 1.1.4</a> you commit yourself to this, that one moves forward and backward, or looks ahead and back, or bends or extends, when not wishing to perform these respective acts. Surely the opposite is the case.</p>
<p><span class="add">Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.5' href='#pts-cs1.1.5'>PTS cs 1.1.5</a>You say, I am wrong, but does it not happen that some one, thinking “I shall go in one direction”, goes in another, or … thinking “I shall hold forth something”, holds forth another? Hence my proposition is tenable.</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. First published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by <span class='editor'>Manfred Wierich</span> and <span class='editor'>Ven. Vimala</span> and proofread by <span class='editor'>Josephine Anderson</span>. Some changes were introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbreviations, i.e., those of cited works and the participants in the controversies, were expanded.</li>
<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
<li>The corrigenda were merged into the text. Some could not be resolved, though.</li>
