<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc194' href='#pc194'></a>: That each of these is visible.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.1-9' href='#pts-cs1.1.1-9'>PTS cs 1.1.1–9</a><span class='add'>The discourse is verbatim identical with <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs6.7'>PTS CS 6.7</a></span>, each of the  “four elements”, “the organ of sight” <span class='add'>alone, and</span> “bodily action” <span class='add'>being substituted for</span> “space”. <span class='add'>The opponent's rejoinders are severally as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> But do we not see earth, a stone, a mountain? water? fire blazing? trees waving in the wind? The eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body? anyone advancing, retreating, looking forward, looking backward, stretching forth, retracting?</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. First published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by <span class='editor'>Manfred Wierich</span> and <span class='editor'>Ven. Vimala</span> and proofread by <span class='editor'>Josephine Anderson</span>. Some changes were introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbreviations, i.e., those of cited works and the participants in the controversies, were expanded.</li>
<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
<li>The corrigenda were merged into the text. Some could not be resolved, though.</li>
